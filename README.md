# AirBnB Clone Project

This project is a clone of AirBnB, aimed at creating a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter allows users to interact with AirBnB objects through a CLI. It supports creating new objects, retrieving objects, performing operations on objects, updating object attributes, and destroying objects.

### How to Start

To start the command interpreter, run the following command:

```
./console.py
```

### How to Use

Once the command interpreter is running, you can use the following commands:

- `create`: Create a new object
- `show`: Show information about an object
- `update`: Update the attributes of an object
- `destroy`: Destroy an object
- `all`: Show all objects or all objects of a specific class
- `quit`: Exit the command interpreter

### Examples

To create a new User object, use the following command:

```
(hbnb) create User
```

To show information about a specific User object, use the following command:

```
(hbnb) show User 1234-5678
```

For more information on available commands, use the `help` command.
